# Challenge

Go back to the following task solutions in chapter 34:

-   `ch34_io_files/task_27_array_in_binary_file_double`;
-   `ch34_io_files/task_28_array_in_binary_file_object`.

There is a lot of repeated or similar code. Using **C++ templates** merge these two solutions into one solution that is universal for any types that can be initialized with a single value and have an overloaded `<<` (ostream) operator.
